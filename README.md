# Challenge-One

Notes For Changes:
HTML
Cleaned up trailing slashes on: lines 5, 30, 37, 44, 54, 61, 68

For all Decorative Images "alt text" was added for description so that the images will be ignored from assistive technologies such as screen readers.

CSS
Consolidated elements that had same visual code.
